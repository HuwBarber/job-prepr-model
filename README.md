## About the Project

### Background and Motivation

For many, practicing for interviews can be tough without somebody to give feedback. JobPrepr is an online tool which empowers users to practice for (non-technical) interviews by allowing them to record responses to questions randomly selected from a pool, and receive feedback on their facial expressions and sentiment of their speech.

Built in a 2 week sprint as part of Le Wagon's Data Science Bootcamp, in collaboration with:

- Andrei Danila - https://github.com/AndreiCDanila
- Martin Skalicky - https://github.com/skoooty
- Milica Šćepanović -
